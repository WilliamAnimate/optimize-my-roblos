what do these files mean??!!

base (comments).json is the base, wouldn't recommend using
CAS_1975.json are for those who don't care about how good the graphics look, but just want to play the game
CAS_lowspec.json are for the slow machines.
CAS_office.json are for the office computers. Assumes that its rather high-spec, if not, then use CAS_lowspec.json
CAS_perf.json are just for performance with minimal visual quality tradeoff. recommended if you have a fast pc
